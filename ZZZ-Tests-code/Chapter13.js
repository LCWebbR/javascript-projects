//CHAPTER 14: UNIT TESTING

//Why test your code?

//unit testing test your code for you

//regression is breaking old code with new code

//use self-documenting code 


//UNIT TESTING IN ACTION 

// a positive test case test within the accepted boundries of the data values  ie 1-100 5 or 55 or 38
//a negative test case tests outside of the acceptible boundires of the data balues ie 1-100 -55, 10000, or 101
//an edge case test the very edge of the accpetible boundries ie 1-100 1 or 100

// write tests before you code so it reduces time fixing bugs
